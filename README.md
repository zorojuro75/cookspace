## Overview

Cookspace Career Application Portal is designed to streamline the recruitment process for both applicants and HR. It features dynamic job listings, a robust application form with file upload support, and a clean, responsive UI. The project leverages Next.js App Router, React hooks, and modular UI components for maintainability and scalability.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Job Listings**: Each job is defined in a TypeScript array and rendered at `/career/[slug]`.
- **Detailed Job Pages**: Each job page displays company info, responsibilities, requirements, benefits, and equal opportunity statements.
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Switch between job details and the application form with a visually distinct, accessible tab UI.
- **Rich Application Form**: Collects applicant info, supports file uploads (resume, cover letter), and validates input.
- **API Integration**: Submits applications to a Next.js API route for processing and storage.
- **Responsive & Accessible**: Mobile-friendly, keyboard navigable, and uses semantic HTML.
- **Customizable UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and modular components for easy theming and extension.

## How to Add a Job Posting

1. Open `app/career/[slug]/page.tsx`.
2. Add a new object to the `jobs` array with all required fields:
   - `title`, `slug`, `location`, `company`, `salary`, `about_us`, `position`, `responsibilities`, `requirements`, `benefits`, `how_to_apply`, `apply_now`, `equal_opportunity`, etc.
3. Ensure the `slug` is unique (used in the URL).
4. The job will be accessible at `/career/[slug]`.

---

## How the Application Process Works

1. **User visits** a job page (e.g., `/career/business-development-executive`).
2. **Job details** are shown in a tabbed interface. The active tab is visually highlighted.
3. **Application form** collects:
   - Name, email, phone
   - Resume (PDF), cover letter (PDF/DOC/DOCX), Google Drive link
4. **Validation** ensures all required fields and file types are correct.
5. **On submit**, the form data is sent as `FormData` to `/api/recruitment`.
6. **API route** processes the application, stores files, and returns a reference number or error.
7. **User receives** a confirmation or error message.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **UI Components**: Modify or extend components in `components/ui/` or `component/` for branding, layout, or new features.
- **API Logic**: Update `app/api/recruitment/route.ts` to change how applications are processed, validated, or stored (e.g., integrate with a database, email, or third-party service).
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS. Update `globals.css` or component classes for custom themes.
- **Add More Fields**: To add more fields to the application form, update the form state and UI in `app/career/[slug]/page.tsx` and handle them in the API route.
- **Internationalization**: Add i18n support if needed for multi-language job listings.

---

## Development & Local Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

- Edit any file in `app/`, `component/`, or `components/ui/` to see instant updates.
- API route changes in `app/api/recruitment/route.ts` are hot-reloaded.

---

## Deployment

- Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), Netlify, or any platform supporting Next.js.
- For Vercel:
  1. Push your code to GitHub.
  2. Connect your repository to Vercel.

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for secure configuration, especially for email delivery via SMTP. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
```

- **SMTP_HOST**: The SMTP server address (e.g., Mailtrap for development/testing).
- **SMTP_PORT**: The port for SMTP (commonly 587 for TLS).
- **SMTP_USERNAME**: Your SMTP username.
- **SMTP_PASSWORD**: Your SMTP password.

> **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or secrets to version control. Use environment variables in your deployment platform for production.
